Hello fellow coders!

### User stories

#### New users

- As a new user, I want to be able to navigate through the website and find what I am looking for with ease.
- As a new user, I want the information I search for to be displayed in a easy explainable way.

#### Common users

- As a common user, I would like the booking process to be as simple to follow as possible.
- As a common user, I want to see as much information about the flights as possible with nothing hidden.
- As a common user, It would nice to see some personalization towards the user based on preferences e.g. languages, common places searched etc.

#### Frequent users

- As a frequent user, I would like to be able to become a member of the website.
- As a frequent user, I love to be able to figure out any questions I have answers too without having to contact the website.

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

Happy coding!
